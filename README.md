unixgpt is a powerful bridge between natural language and UNIX commands.

A valid OpenAI API Key is required to run unixgpt (you can get one here: https://openai.com/blog/openai-api)

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="enter key here"
```

The latest version of ```unixgpt``` can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install unixgpt
```

To upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade unixgpt
```

## Building Locally

### Docker

Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t unixgpt-cli .
```

Create and run the Docker container (with a valid OpenAI API Key)

```bash
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY unixgpt-cli
```

**Note:** Input can be edited in Dockerfile

### pip

Build via pip (from source code)

```bash
pip install .
```

Run via pip

```bash
unixgpt -i "enter input here"
```

## Features

1. **Conversion:** Seamlessly transform natural language queries into their corresponding UNIX commands.

2. **Command Options:** After generating a command, enjoy the following flexibility:

- **Execute:** Execute the generated UNIX command directly.
- **Save:** Store frequently used commands locally for swift and convenient access.
- **Copy:** Copy the generated command to the clipboard, simplifying pasting and use in your terminal.

3. **Reusability:** It's not just about storing commands; it's a versatile tool for saving and editing custom commands via natural language, ensuring your workflow remains flexible and efficient.
